    "Bandwidth:\n",
    "1. In the context of computer networks, elaborate on the concept of bandwidth. Discuss how bandwidth influences the speed and efficiency of data transfer. Provide examples of scenarios where both high and low bandwidth can impact the performance of internet connected devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Answer: Bandwidth is the maximum volume of data that a network connection can transmit within a specific timeframe, influencing the speed and efficiency of data transfer. A higher bandwidth enables the transmission of more data in a shorter period, resulting in faster transfer speeds. For activities like video streaming or large file downloads, a fast and stable internet connection is crucial. Conversely, low bandwidth in remote areas can lead to slow browsing, streaming issues, and extended download times.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer Network:\n",
    "2. Explore computer networks by detailing the key components and their interplay. Discuss the significance of scalability, security, and reliability in designing computer networks. Provide real-world examples of how different types of computer networks, such as local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs), serve distinct purposes in various settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Answer: Computer networks comprise essential components such as routers, switches, modems, and protocols like TCP/IP, working together to facilitate communication and data sharing. Scalability is crucial for network design, allowing for expansion and accommodating more devices and users. Security measures, like firewalls and encryption, are essential to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. Reliability ensures consistent network operation, handling disruptions or failures. In a local area network (LAN), scalability facilitates easy device connection, security safeguards confidential files, and reliability ensures uninterrupted communication. In wide area networks (WANs), such as the internet, strong security measures are needed to protect data transmitted between dispersed locations.\n",

    "Packet Switching:\n",
    "3. Investigate packet switching and its role in modern communication systems. Compare and contrast packet switching with alternative methods, such as circuit switching, highlighting the advantages that packet switching brings to data transmission. Describe the journey of a data packet through a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Answer: Packet switching, a method in modern communication systems, involves dividing data into small packets before transmission. These packets travel independently through the network, taking different paths to reach their destination. Packet switching offers advantages like efficient use of network resources, allowing concurrent use of available bandwidth. It enhances robustness and resilience, as packets can take alternative routes in the presence of congestion or unavailability. The packet's journey involves encapsulation with source and destination addresses, traversal through routers that forward it using the best available path, and reassembly at the destination. This process ensures efficient and reliable data transmission across computer networks."
